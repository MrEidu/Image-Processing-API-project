# Image Processing API Project
Hello! This project is part of the first project of Udacity Full-Stack Javascript Developer

### Update to 6th Revision.
The copyfiles has been moved to devDependencies

### A message for the 5th Revision.
For some reason, this project only seems to work for me.
The last 2 revisions, the path or source that uses the server to get the images doesn't seem to work.
I have tried to copy those before the compiler and jasmine does their job, but somehow it keeps failing when this project is being reviewed. I don't know if this is a OS problem, since the first two revisions didn't had problems with the image being resized.

I decided to create [This Video](https://youtu.be/uIO1ayPY-WM) to showcase that I honestly don't know why this fails when it's reviewed.

## Scripts
These are the following scripts to test and run the server:
```bash
npm run test
npm run start
```
Eslint and Prettier finally worked!!! Thanks!!!!!!
Here are the scripts I used: (I do not intent to delete them nor uninstall them if I get stuck in another project)
```bash
npm run prettier
npm run lint
```
